# Quotes API
## DRF Level Two Assessment Project
### [Udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-guide-to-django-rest-framework-and-vue-js/)

Letâ€™s check the proper acquisition of all your new programming skills by
creating a new Web API which will provide a list of **Quotes**!
- Create/Update/Delete permissions must be granted exclusively to admin
users
- Anonymous users must be able to retrieve the available records
paginated in groups of 30 quotes each.

The project requires using a single Model (you can call it **Quote**) which must
include the following fields:
- quote_author
- quote_body
- context
- source
- created_at

To write the views, you must use the **Concrete View Classes**.
